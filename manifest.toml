## The Vibe

```
You: "I want an app for tracking expenses"
     |
Claude: Asks a few questions
     |
Claude: Builds everything (hidden complexity)
     |
You: Done! [Preview] [Deploy]
```

3. Security checks (OWASP)
4. Code review (auto-fix issues)

User only sees pass or fail - never the process.

## Templates

- What tests to write
- How to deploy

Just describe what you want. Vibe coding at its finest.
