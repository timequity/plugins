Give me a hands-on exercise to practice Claude Code.

Based on my current level and recent topics, create a practical exercise:

## Exercise Format

1. **Task**: Clear, specific goal (1-2 sentences)

2. **Steps**: What to do (numbered)

3. **Verify**: How to check it worked

4. **Hint**: Available if I get stuck (don't show immediately)

## Example (Foundations level):

```
TASK: Create your first CLAUDE.md file

STEPS:
1. Create a file called CLAUDE.md in your project root
2. Add a ## Project section with your project name
3. Add a ## Commands section with one command you use often

VERIFY:
- Ask me "what do you know about this project?"
- I should mention details from your CLAUDE.md

HINT (if stuck):
Start with just: # CLAUDE.md\n\n## Project\nMy awesome app
```

## Levels

- **Foundations**: File operations, basic commands, CLAUDE.md
- **Intermediate**: Custom commands, MCP setup, hooks
- **Advanced**: Custom skills, agents, complex workflows

Match exercise difficulty to my demonstrated level.

After I complete it, validate my work and offer the next exercise or topic.
