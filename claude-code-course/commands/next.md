Continue my Claude Code learning from where I left off.

Check our conversation history to determine:
1. My current level (foundations/intermediate/advanced)
2. Last topic we covered
3. What's next in the curriculum

If this is a new conversation:
- Briefly recap what we covered before (if I mentioned it)
- Or ask what I'd like to continue with
- Suggest logical next steps based on typical learning paths

If I haven't started yet, redirect to /cc:start.

Keep it brief — just get me back on track.
