Start your Claude Code learning journey.

Use the `learning-path` skill to assess my current knowledge level through Socratic questions.

Guidelines:
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Use multiple choice (A/B/C/D) options
- Based on answers, route me to the appropriate level:
  - Foundations (new user)
  - Intermediate (comfortable user)
  - Advanced (power user)
- After determining level, introduce the first topic
- Keep it encouraging and practical
