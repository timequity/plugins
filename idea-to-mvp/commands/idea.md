description: Start building from a simple idea
---

Use the idea-validation skill to understand what the user wants to build.

Ask simple, non-technical questions:
1. What problem does this solve?
2. Who has this problem?
3. What's the first thing they'd do?
4. How do they know it worked?

One question at a time. Accept short answers. Move fast - 4 questions max.

After validation, ask: "Ready to start building?"
