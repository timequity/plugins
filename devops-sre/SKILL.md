Build and operate reliable, scalable infrastructure.

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **terraform-expert** | Infrastructure as Code |
| **kubernetes-ops** | Container orchestration |
| **monitoring-setup** | Observability stack |
| **incident-response** | Handle outages |
| **ci-cd-pipelines** | Automated deployments |
| **cost-optimization** | FinOps, rightsizing |
| **security-hardening** | CIS benchmarks, scanning |
| **disaster-recovery** | Backup, DR planning |

## Templates

- **terraform-aws** - AWS infrastructure modules
- **k8s-manifests** - Kubernetes deployment configs
- **monitoring-stack** - Prometheus + Grafana

## Philosophy

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Version everything
- **Immutable** - Replace, don't patch
- **Observable** - If it's not monitored, it's broken
- **Automated** - Humans for decisions, machines for execution
